  cardLog3: How you doing, boss. Me and the old cocker spaniel have been worrying
    about you, but we know you're having fun with your friends, so we didn't want
    to bother you. But I figured you could use some money, so here. I know it's not
    a lot, and we wish we could do more, but you know this old lady isn't feeling
    too well. But this should be enough to get yourself something good. A burger
    or sandwich, maybe, with crispy bacon. We know you like to it! If we've learned
    anything, it's the little things like that that keep you going. A little sandwich
    and some rest is what you need to get ready for the next day. And we know you
    like to eat! Be sure to say hello to ____ for us, too. There should be enough
    money there to get them something to eat, too. Love you.
